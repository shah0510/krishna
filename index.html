        <h2>The Story</h2>
        Shri Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudev, however was brought up by Yashoda and Nanda in Vrindavan. The festival generally falls on the Ashtami Tithi of Krishna Paksha or 8th day of the dark fortnight on the month of Bhadrapad . It is said that lord Krishna was born in Mathura Prison. Therein, his life was in danger from his maternal uncle, kansa. The tyrant Kansa, was told by a voice in the sky that one of her children would kill him. Kansa decided to kill Devaki so that she does not give rise to any children, but Vasudeva, her husband begged Kansa to forgive Devki and promised that he will give any of her child to Kansa, so then Kansa on this assurance from Vasudev, let Devki go. He imprisoned both Devaki and Vasudeva. Kansa made sure that none of her children survived. Therefore, in order to protect lord Krishna, his father Vasudev carried him in a basket across the raging River Yamuna to Vrindavan. There Krishna was adopted and brought up by Yashoda and Nanda. <b>Happy Krishna Janmashtami!</b>

        <p>The Celebration….</p>
        <p>
          People Celebrate Janmashtami at midnight, because <br> it is believed that Lord Krishna was born at midnight.<br> The devotees keep fast to show gratitude and <br> devotion to lord Krishna. Since Sri Krishna was <br> fond of eating Makhan, people play this sport where  <br> an earthen pot or matki is tied high from the ground.

          The meaning of the Sanskrit word Janmashtami can be understood by splitting it into the two words, "Janma" and "Ashtami." The word "Janma" means birth and the word "Ashtami" means eight; thus, Krishna Janmashtami is the celebration of Krishna's birth on the eighth day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in the month of Shravana (August–September).

          Throughout Krishna's childhood and young adult life, Balarama, Krishna's half-brother, was a "constant companion" for him. Balarama joined Krishna in the major events that are celebrated in Vraja, Brindavan, Dravarka, and Mathura such as stealing butter, chasing calves, playing in the cow pens, and participating in wrestling matches.
